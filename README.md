#### (Recurrent Neural Network Italian Cooking Recipes)

To get the dataset run in this order:  
`1_get_pages.py` to get all the links (or already included in the repo)  
`2_get_dataset.py` to extract the recipes from the links  
`3_generate_txt_dataset.py` to generate a single txt file from all the extracted recipes (probably needs a bit of character cleaning)
